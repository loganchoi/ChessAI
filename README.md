# Chess AI with Limited Iterative Deepening, Min-Max, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and API State Recognition

## Overview

Welcome to the Chess AI project! This repository is the home of a chess-playing artificial intelligence that utilizes advanced techniques, including limited iterative deepening, the min-max algorithm, alpha-beta pruning, and state recognition through an API. The development focuses on achieving a remarkable 30% improvement in runtime every week.

## Features

- **Limited Iterative Deepening:** Gradually enhances search depth for improved performance.
- **Min-Max Algorithm:** Evaluates potential moves using the min-max algorithm.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Optimizes the search process by reducing the number of nodes evaluated.
- **API State Recognition:** Dynamically adapts to the game state through an external API.
- **Continuous Improvement:** A commitment to achieving a 30% improvement in runtime each week.
